Data format:
```json
{
    "tokens": ["Others", ",", "though", ",", "are", "novices", "."], 
    "entities": [{"type": "PER", "start": 0, "end": 1}, {"type": "PER", "start": 5, "end": 6}], "relations": [], "org_id": "CNN_IP_20030328.1600.07", 
    "ltokens": ["WOODRUFF", "We", "know", "that", "some", "of", "the", "American", "troops", "now", "fighting", "in", "Iraq", "are", "longtime", "veterans", "of", "warfare", ",", "probably", "not", "most", ",", "but", "some", ".", "Their", "military", "service", "goes", "back", "to", "the", "Vietnam", "era", "."],

}
```

The `ltokens` contains the tokens from the previous sentence. And The `rtokens` contains the tokens from the next sentence.

Due to the license, we cannot directly release our preprocessed datasets of ACE04, ACE05, KBP17, NNE and OntoNotes. We only release the preprocessed GENIA, FewNERD, MSRA and CoNLL03 datasets. Download them from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UttZVSL9iAqxsfPfMfSAl9FYc4DytfP5?usp=sharing). 

If you need other datasets, please contact me (`syl@zju.edu.cn`) by email. Note that you need to state your identity and prove that you have obtained the license.
## Example

### Train


```bash
python piqn.py train --config configs/nested.conf
```

Note: You should edit this [line](https://github.com/tricktreat/piqn/blob/e161cfa373ddd3e5162f71e260c7d6f3946eff33/config_reader.py#L21) in `config_reader.py` according to the actual number of GPUs. 

### Evaluation

You can download our [checkpoints on ACE04 and ACE05](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rIgz4gBn_Na3KjFa21dEvHDY03fekwv3?usp=sharing), or train your own model and then evaluate the model. Because of the limited space of Google Cloud Drive, we share the other models in Baidu Cloud Drive, please download at [this link (code: js9z)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ULV2XEobLv8-LlwjkIy5ig).
```bash
python piqn.py eval --config configs/batch_eval.conf
```

If you use the checkpoints (ACE05 and ACE04) we provided, you will get the following results:
