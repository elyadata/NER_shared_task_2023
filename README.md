# ELYADATA Systems for Arabic NER Shared Task 2023

This repository contains the work carried out for the submission to the [NER shared task of 2023](https://dlnlp.ai/st/wojood/) 
in the context of the first Arabic NLP conference, [ArabicNLP 2023](https://arabicnlp2023.sigarab.org/home).

There is also the `Data_preprocessing` folder which contains the re-sampling experiments, the data cleaning scripts,
and also the scripts for data preparation that convert the Wojood text files from an IOB format, to a format compatible 
with each model.

Detailed instructions on how to train the models and perform data-preprocessing are available in the `readme.md` files 
of each folder.
